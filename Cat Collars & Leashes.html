<h1>Collars/ Leashes Available</h1>
<p>A standard flat leash is a common choice for dogs and cats. Flat cat leashes tend to be narrower than dog leashes, but that's not always the case. These are a good choice because they are less likely to tangle when a cat rolls in the grass, and they are easy to untangle when knots do happen. Because of this resilience, you may want to start your kitten's leash training young -- think around 8 weeks of age, if possible. A young kitten may be more open to the concept of walking outdoors with a leash than a more seasoned counterpart. Cat flea collars are one of the most effective ways of dealing with fleas when used correctly. Experts say you should put a collar on your kitten as soon as she's ready to explore the world around her. This would be around the time when she's 2 to 6 months old. The more important factor here is her weight and the size of her neck as these will determine the fit of the collar.</p>

Don't use a collar with a cat leash; a leash should be paired with a sturdy cat harness. “If it is unlikely that your cat will get out at night, it is OK to take it off at night,” Koski says. (Of course, you could always just get a collar without a bell — problem solved.)Cats, whether they are indoor or outdoor pets, should wear their collar all the time. That means you shouldn't take off their collars at any time of the day or night. Once you put this neckpiece around their necks, you don't have to remove it anymore unless you're upgrading the size.</p>
