	<td style= "padding-left:50px;  padding-right: 50px;"><p style="font-size:23px;"> The Persian cat is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in English-speaking countries. The first documented ancestors of Persian cats were imported into Italy from Persia around 1620.

History
As one of the oldest cat breeds, Persian cats can be traced all the way back to the 1600s. While there are question marks about where they came from, they’re believed to have originated in Mesopotamia, later called Persia (hence the name), which is now modern day Iran. It’s said that they were smuggled out of Persia by European explorers in the 17th century.


Caring for a Persian Cat
Like all cats, Persians need a healthy diet, daily exercise, and lots of love as well as a little special attention when it comes to grooming. These tips can help keep your Persian cat’s motor running and minimize the hair you’ll find around your house. </p></td>

Though Persian cats are quite friendly, they require gentle handling, which means no roughhousing or grabbing from young children. They get along great with kind, respectful kids, but would rather be stroked and admired than engage in strenuous activities. Persians also enjoy the company of other cats and gentle dogs. Persians love to sprawl out in favorite spot in the home with good vantage points to keep an eye on the goings-on in the household, be it a plush chair or sun-filled window ledge. Persians are homebodies. It’s best to keep them indoors to prevent overheating or tangling up their profuse, long coats. Persian cats love their human families, but they don’t mind being left alone for short periods of time as long as they are in their own homes where they feel comfortable and safe.</p></td>

	<td style= "padding-left:50px;  padding-right: 50px;"><p style="font-size:23px;">The Munchkin is a relatively new breed of cat characterized by its very short legs, which are caused by genetic mutation. The Munchkin is considered to be the original breed of dwarf cat.Munchkin cats are quick, energetic, fun-loving, and affectionate. What they lack in leg length they more than make up for with their unique look and loving temperament. The Munchkin, as you may have guessed from her name, is on the short side. She's actually unique among dwarf cat breeds—this petite kitty actually fits all the other size indicators of a normal adult-sized cat, except for their little legs. Never heard of a Munchkin? That's probably because they're relatively new, having been legitimized by The International Cat Association as their own breed in the early 2000s.Because these cats are the result of genetic mutation and a somewhat complicated breeding process, they are relatively rare. If you're wondering how much Munchkin cats cost, you can expect to spend between $500–$1200 for your feline, depending on pedigree.</p></td>

	<td style= "padding-left: 80px; padding-top: 30px"><p style= "font-size: 23px;">Despite their small stature, Munchkins have big personalities and carry their kitten-like personality through with them into adulthood. They are playful, outgoing and easy to train. They are very sociable and loving cats who make fantastic family pets as they get along well with children and other pets. Don’t assume their small size prevents them from doing what cats do best – Munchkins can run and jump just like any other breed of cat.Munchkins are a typically healthy breed and are not particularly prone to any conditions or diseases. However, since this is such a young breed, this could change. As with Dachshunds and Corgis, Munchkin cat owners should be sure not to overfeed their cat and ensure it gets enough exercise, as obesity could be an issue and could reduce the cat’s mobility.</p></td>

Although Kinkalows are a relatively new breed, they have won the hearts of many cat lovers. The Kinkalow dates back to the middle of the ‘90s, making it a newer feline breed. Development began when a U.S. breeder named Terri Harris began crossing Munchkins with American Curls. Through this experimental program, she simply wanted to see what the result of the cross would be, but she was able to successfully create a new breed that showcased both short legs and curled ears (the two most distinct features of the parent breeds). The Kinkalow is considered an exotic and rare breed. It received Experimental Breed status from The International Cat Association (TICA), and the breed has also been recognized by The Dwarf Cat Association (TDCA).</p></td>

However, if you are looking for a show cat or breeding quality Bombay, you should expect to pay between $750 to $2,000 depending on the bloodlines and gender of the cat.The Kinkalow combines two cat breeds: The Munchkin and the American Curl. Munchkin cats are considered dwarf felines, and Kinkalows get their small stature, short legs, and long body from this parent breed. The American Curl is known for its unique curled ears that at first glance look hamster-like. The Kinkalow has inherited the curled ears that bend to varying degrees. Kittens usually start with straight ears like other feline varieties, but the ears will eventually curl as the kittens grow. However, some Kinkalows never develop curled ears even though they carry the genetic programming for them. In addition to being energetic and playful, the Kinkalow is also well-known for its endearing curiosity and intelligence. The breed is also very social and eager to please and loves to be in the center of any activity.</p></td>

Outside of the United States, the breed is usually referred to as simply the Angora or Ankara cat. Up until recently, it only survived extinction as the result of a zoo in Turkey. The Turkish Angora, though generally healthy, is prone to a few rare conditions. If inherited, the kittens of this breed are prone to hereditary ataxia, which causes them to have shaky movements.</p></td>

It gets along well with everyone -- children, seniors, visitors. It is devoted to its human family and does not do well to be left alone. The cost of a Turkish Angora cat will depend on how old the cat is and where it is purchased from. To adopt one, the cost can be as little as $75, but purchasing kittens from a breeder can range from $650 to $2,000 each. Turkish Angoras have long, silky coats, and elegant, sinuous bodies. A young Turkish Angora may be mistaken for a snow weasel. Though it is known for a shimmery white coat and posh tail, Turkish Angoras can display a variety of colors. They come in tabby, black, chocolate brown, and smoke-colored varieties. Eyes may be blue, green, amber, yellow, as well as heterochromatic. Ears are pointed, large and wide-set. The eyes are almond shaped and the profile forms two straight planes. The plumed tail is often carried upright, perpendicular to the back</p></td>

The most familiar colour variant is the "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, orange eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint. It is one of the most ancient cat breeds known. In modern times, it remains the most popular pedigreed breed in its native country, as registered by the UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). A quarter of all kittens registered with the GCCF each year are British Shorthairs, making the British the most popular pedigree cat in the UK.</p></td>

Despite her heavy boning and musculature, you want to make certain she keeps a proper weight and does not get out of condition. She must get adequate exercise. Interactive play may be necessary to keep the breed in good shape. The British will play when she wants to play and will find a toy or create one out of anything she finds if a cat toy is not available. A daily brushing is important, especially during seasonal changes when the coat is thickening or thinning. Even this Shorthair cat can get knots in her coat if she isn't brushed regularly. The British tolerates being left alone. She is affectionate but also spends time just sleeping in the sun. The British is an easy cat to care for and makes a wonderful, quiet companion. The British Shorthair, while originally coming from the farms and streets of Britain, is also considered to be the first cat of the cat fancy. The "father" of this breed is Harrison Wier, who is thought of as the first professional cat breeder.</p></td>

Start young by introducing your kitten to other people, children, animals, the car, and even a leash and harness for outdoor jaunts. Because they're so intelligent, Bengals benefit from a wide range of experiences to keep them engaged, so work with them early and often. It also helps to provide plenty of cat toys and rotate them out every few weeks so your cat doesn't get bored. Although crosses between Asian leopard cats and domestic cats occurred as early as the 1800s, the breed didn't really come into its own until the mid-20th century. Breeder and conservationist Jean Mill first crossed a domestic cat with an Asian leopard cat in 1963, according to the Cat Fanciers' Association. By 1996, Bengals were registered by the CFA. The accepted animals come from the F6 generation or higher.</p></td>

An interesting characteristic is that the coat is shaggy and drapes longer on the stomach and behind the legs (britches) but is shorter over the shoulders.

If you crave a warm cuddle buddy for those cold nights in Siberia–or wherever you live–the Siberian cat may be the perfect feline family member for you.

When you come home from work, he might not have a martini waiting, but he will be pleased to tell you all about his day in quiet, pleasant trills and chirps, interspersed with a few meows and purrs. Guests will find him to be a genial host; this is not typically a cat who is shy in the presence of strangers.</p></td>
